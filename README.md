# concurrent slice

## Use Case

If your application frequently involves concurrent read/write operations to a slice shared across multiple goroutines, then a concurrent slice can help simplify your code and make it safer.

### Alternatives

In many cases, other concurrency patterns or data structures might be more suitable. Channels can sometimes be used to manage concurrent data flow more idiomatically in Go.

### Complexity

While a concurrent slice adds some overhead in terms of complexity and potential performance costs (due to locking), it can be worthwhile if it significantly simplifies the concurrency management in your application.
